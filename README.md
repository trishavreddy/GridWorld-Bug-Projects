# GridWorld-Bug-Projects
A recreation and extension of the GridWorld case study, originally coded in 10th grade. Features include a custom Bug class and multiple subclasses with enhanced behavior. Demonstrates introduction to object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and creative problem-solving in Java.

## Features

### Bug Implementations
- **BoxBug**: Moves in a square pattern.
- **CircleBug**: Moves in a circular pattern.
- **DancingBug**: Changes direction based on a custom "dance sequence."
- **IsoscelesBug**: Creates shapes inspired by isosceles triangles.
- **SpiralBug**: Moves in an outward spiral pattern.
- **VBug**: Moves in a "V" shape.
- **ZBug**: Moves in a "Z" shape.

### Runners
Each bug has a corresponding `Runner` class (e.g., `BoxBugRunner`) that demonstrates its behavior in the GridWorld environment.

## Sample Output
Your bug will move around in a grid, leaving flowers and showcasing custom behaviors.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and abstract classes
- Dynamic behaviors and algorithms
- Creative problem-solving in grid-based systems
